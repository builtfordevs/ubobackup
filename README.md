# ubobackup
A uBlock Origin element filter list backup built over time to remove useless trash from websites. 

Current element count: 5000 

The list is not entirely efficient so that above number sort of... doesn't say much.
The sites are almost all in English and i browse on mobile so this list is probably only good for mobile browsing at the moment.

Purpose: to remove useless and annoying elements which nobody wants to see from some poppular sites (the ones i could visit so far, **mostly news sites**).

Again, it **removes everything but the most strictly relavant content**

Example: 

How an article from this site looks usually:

How all the articles from this site will look with the filter:

That's the content of the entire tab window.
